            <h3>Where do I start?</h3>
            <p>
                We recommend learning Python first, as it is easy to learn, but also powerful.
                If there is a specific device you want to target, look at the table below to see what you can do with a few languages.
            </p>
            
            <h3>What do I do when I get stuck?</h3>
            <p>
                One thing you can do is ask someone at the club meeting for advice.
                Another thing you can do is look for an answer or submit a question on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a>.
                StackOverflow is a popular website that helps answer all your questions.
            </p>
            
            <h3>How do I get better?</h3>
            <p>
                The only way that you can get better is by practicing.
                Practice by coming up with a goal, and write a program to accomplish it.
                It does not matter if someone has already written a program to do it, you can challenge yourself by making your own.
                Challenge yourself by writing something that you can not currently make.
                When you get stuck, refer to the "What do I do when I get stuck" question.
                If you need ideas, <a href="http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/">this site</a> has a list of some.

                    Java is a popular programming language.
                    It is used to write programs for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android, and more.
                    It is also the language used in the AP class.

                <p>
                    We recommend doing Getting Started, Learning the Java Language, then Essential Java Classes.
                    After you have done those 3, branch off and learn things as you need them.
